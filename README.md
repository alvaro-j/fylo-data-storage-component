## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Use <b>CSS variables</b> to optimize the development: in this case, i defined the site colors.
```css
:root {
  --pale-blue: hsl(243, 100%, 93%);
  --grayish-blue: hsl(229, 7%, 55%);
  --dark-blue: hsl(228, 56%, 26%);
  --very-dark-blue: hsl(229, 57%, 11%);
  --light-pink: hsl(6, 100%, 80%);
  --pink: hsl(335, 100%, 65%);
}
```
- Use <b>CSS background shorthand</b> to simplify the code.
```css 
body {
  background: var(--very-dark-blue) url(images/bg-desktop.png) no-repeat fixed bottom;
}
```
### Useful resources

- [Speech bubbles](http://nicolasgallagher.com/pure-css-speech-bubbles/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to make speech bubbles. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to understand this concept.
